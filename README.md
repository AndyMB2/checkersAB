# checkersAB
In the following program I will be programing a checker board in python with a graphic
library  by John M. Zelle. This program will show my skils as  programmer and the step by
step process to me creating the checker board. The program will be able to import the 
classes and functions from the graphics library, create objects from those classes, and
perform methods upon certain objects.
